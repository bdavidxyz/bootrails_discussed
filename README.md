# A place for Bootrails users

Docs, bugs, feature request. This is a repository dedicated to https://bootrails.com

Bootrails itself is not open-source, but we wanted a place where users and administrators can freely discuss about it.

You can open any discussion under https://github.com/bdavidxyz/bootrails_place/discussions

So far the wiki contains all articles related to the product itself : https://github.com/bdavidxyz/bootrails_place/wiki
